            Welcome to Orion. This is a trial service to provide easy access to the Melbourne Research
            Cloud through a product called Researcher Desktop. Over the next few months, we will be monitoring the service and collecting feedback to assess the
            viability of a production service. During this beta phase, Researcher Desktops should not be considered
            production-ready. The service is intended for the exclusive use of the University of Melbourne researchers,
            including Academic continuing and fixed term staff, and graduate researchers (PhD and Masters by Research).
            This excludes professional and honorary staff, and all non-RHD students.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may use the Researcher Desktop to support your research activities when you need more computation
            resource than you currently have and you want to work with a familiar operating system, or you need a
            computer that can run calculations 24x7, or you need short-term access to an operating system or compute
            configuration that you don’t have.
        </p>
