                    <dt>How do I reboot my Virtual Desktop?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        You can reboot your Virtual Desktop in two ways:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Soft reboot;</b> You can log into your Virtual Desktop and reboot it as you would a regular
                                laptop/desktop through clicking 'Power Off', 'Restart'
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Hard reboot;</b> Hard rebooting is the process of shutting down the Researcher
                                Desktop and restarting it after the power has been completely turned off. This clears
                                the Virtual Desktop's RAM and can be used as a way to reset the system when
                                required. You can hard reboot your Virtual Desktop by clicking the "Reboot my Virtual Desktop"
                                button on the website
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>My Virtual Desktop has shut down. How can I restart it?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        If your Virtual Desktop shuts down the website will detect this, and if you refresh the
                        website it will replace the "Open Virtual Desktop" button with a "Start my Virtual Desktop" button.
                        Clicking this will start your Virtual Desktop back up again. Once your Virtual Desktop has rebooted
                        successfully you will be able to access it again
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Why and how should I boost my Virtual Desktop?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <b>Why:</b> When you require more computation power (more cores and RAM) to carry out your
                        research activities you can boost your Virtual Desktop from the standard compute flavour
                        (4 cores and 16GB RAM) to the boosted compute flavour (16 cores and 64GB RAM)
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        <b>How:</b> You can boost your Virtual Desktop by clicking on the "Options" drop-down on
                        the website and clicking the "Boost my Virtual Desktop" button
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Why and how should I shelve my Virtual Desktop?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <b>Why:</b> If you are not going to use your Virtual Desktop actively for a period of
                        time and you would like to preserve the state of your Virtual Desktop, instead of deleting
                        it you can shelve your Virtual Desktop. This saves the state of the Virtual Desktop to
                        disk and frees the resources to be available for other researchers, and helps us keep this
                        service available to everyone. The saved state can then later be un-shelved to load your
                        Virtual Desktop back to the state it was in before shelving
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        <b>How:</b> You can shelve your Virtual Desktop by simply clicking the "Shelve my Virtual Desktop" button
                        on the website. You can get your Virtual Desktop back by clicking the "Unshelve my Virtual Desktop"
                        button, which will relaunch the Virtual Desktop with all your previous data
                    </dd>
                    <dt>What are vCPUs with respect to my Virtual Desktop?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A vCPU represents a portion or share of the underlying, physical CPU that is assigned to a
                        particular Virtual Desktop. Virtual Desktops are launched in the ARDC Nectar Research Cloud where
                        the physical cores are hyper-threaded at 1:2 ratio and each logical core is oversubscribed.
                        Hence a 4 vCPU Virtual Desktop is a single physical core machine.

                    <dd>This is not currently actively supported, but to give others access, you need to run the
                        following commands in the terminal on your Virtual Desktop:
                        <div class="codeblock">
                            <div>/usr/local/bin/accessctl -u [username]@[domain]</div>

                        Even with this, the second user's experience will not be the same as yours, as a lot of
                        tailoring has been done to refine your experience on Virtual Desktop</dd>
                    <dt>Can I use OneDrive on my Virtual Desktop?</dt>
                    <dd>Yes, OneDrive is the recommended method of transferring files to your Virtual Desktop. It is
                        accessed through a program called ExpandDrive, which is documented
                        <a target="_blank" href="{{kba_url}}KB0022192">in this KBA</a></dd>
                    <dt>Can I mount department shares on my Virtual Desktop?</dt>
                    <dd>Yes, the university's departmental network shares are automatically mounted on the Researcher
                        Desktop just like your desktop/laptop. The shares you have access to are based on your login.
                        This is located in the 'Shares' folder from your home folder. i.e. ~/Shares</dd>
