                    <dt>How do I reboot my Researcher Desktop?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        You can reboot your Researcher Desktop in two ways:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Soft reboot;</b> You can log into your Researcher Desktop and reboot it as you would a regular
                                laptop/desktop through clicking 'Power Off', 'Restart'
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Hard reboot;</b> Hard rebooting is the process of shutting down the Researcher
                                Desktop and restarting it after the power has been completely turned off. This clears
                                the Researcher Desktop's RAM and can be used as a way to reset the system when
                                required. You can hard reboot your Researcher Desktop by clicking the "Reboot my Researcher Desktop"
                                button on the website
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>My Researcher Desktop has shut down. How can I restart it?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        If your Researcher Desktop shuts down the website will detect this, and if you refresh the
                        website it will replace the "Open Researcher Desktop" button with a "Start my Researcher Desktop" button.
                        Clicking this will start your Researcher Desktop back up again. Once your Researcher Desktop has rebooted
                        successfully you will be able to access it again
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Why and how should I boost my Researcher Desktop?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <b>Why:</b> When you require more computation power (more cores and RAM) to carry out your
                        research activities you can boost your Researcher Desktop from the standard compute flavour
                        (4 cores and 16GB RAM) to the boosted compute flavour (16 cores and 64GB RAM)
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        <b>How:</b> You can boost your Researcher Desktop by clicking on the "Options" drop-down on
                        the website and clicking the "Boost my Researcher Desktop" button
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Why and how should I shelve my Researcher Desktop?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <b>Why:</b> If you are not going to use your Researcher Desktop actively for a period of
                        time and you would like to preserve the state of your Researcher Desktop, instead of deleting
                        it you can shelve your Researcher Desktop. This saves the state of the Researcher Desktop to
                        disk and frees the resources to be available for other researchers, and helps us keep this
                        service available to everyone. The saved state can then later be un-shelved to load your
                        Researcher Desktop back to the state it was in before shelving
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        <b>How:</b> You can shelve your Researcher Desktop by simply clicking the "Shelve my Researcher Desktop" button
                        on the website. You can get your Researcher Desktop back by clicking the "Unshelve my Researcher Desktop"
                        button, which will relaunch the Researcher Desktop with all your previous data
                    </dd>
                    <dt>What are vCPUs with respect to my Researcher Desktop?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A vCPU represents a portion or share of the underlying, physical CPU that is assigned to a
                        particular Researcher Desktop. Researcher Desktops are launched in Melbourne Research Cloud where
                        the physical cores are hyper-threaded at 1:2 ratio and each logical core is oversubscribed.
                        Hence a 4 vCPU Researcher Desktop is a single physical core machine.

                    <dd>
                        An RDP file is associated with a specific Windows Researcher Desktop.
                        You should download a new RDP file every time you create a new Windows Researcher Desktop.
                        You may use the same RDP file to access your Windows Researcher Desktop until you
                        create a new Windows Researcher Desktop. But you can download a new file whenever you like

                        The University's Software Center is pre-installed in the Researcher Desktop.

                        Yes, you can. Open File Explorer and go to Network, you will see a prompt ("Network discovery is turned offâ€¦").
                        You'll need to turn on Network discovery to see devices on the network that are sharing files.
                        To turn it on, select the <i>Network discovery is turned off banner,</i> then select Turn on network
                        discovery and file sharing. Mapping a network drive is discussed in the KBA

                        following commands in the terminal on your Researcher Desktop:
                        <div class="codeblock">
