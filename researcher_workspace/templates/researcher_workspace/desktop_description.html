    <p>
        This service allows you to easily and quickly create a Virtual Desktop - A Personal Computer in the cloud that you can use as an extra compute resource for your research. You may find this useful to free up your laptop/workstation or to have a computer that you can leave running for uninterrupted processing for up to 14 days and then choose to renew after 14 days. The Virtual Desktop runs on the Nectar Research Cloud and offers a number of different desktop environments.
