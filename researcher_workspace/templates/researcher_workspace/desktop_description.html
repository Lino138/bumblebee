        This service allows you to easily and quickly create a Virtual Desktop - a personal computer in the cloud that you can use as an extra compute resource for your research. You may find this
        useful to free up your laptop/workstation or to have a computer that you can leave running for long periods of
        uninterrupted processing. The Virtual Desktop Service runs on the ARDC Nectar Research Cloud.
