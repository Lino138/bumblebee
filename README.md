# Bumblebee

Bumblebee is a Django-based project designed to provide a simple interface for
users to be able to spin-up HTML5 virtual desktops for research workflows.

This code is developed by the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) from
the Researcher Desktop project developed by the University of Melbourne.
